# Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development

## Overview

These weeks focus on the unique challenges of humanoid robot development, including kinematics, dynamics, locomotion, and manipulation. Students will learn about bipedal locomotion, balance control, and natural human-robot interaction design.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of these weeks, students will be able to:
- Understand humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- Implement bipedal locomotion and balance control
- Design manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands
- Create natural human-robot interaction
- Appreciate the unique challenges of humanoid robotics

## Key Concepts with Analogies

- **Humanoid Kinematics**: Like understanding human joint movements, robot kinematics describes the motion of robot joints
- **Balance Control**: Like how humans maintain balance while walking, robots need control systems to stay upright
- **Natural Interaction**: Like how humans naturally interact with each other, robots should interact naturally with humans

## Hands-on Lab: Implementing Bipedal Control

In this lab, students will implement basic bipedal locomotion for a simulated humanoid robot.

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of ROS 2
- Completed previous modules
- Basic understanding of physics and control systems

### Steps
1. Set up a humanoid robot model in simulation
2. Implement inverse kinematics for leg movement
3. Create a balance control system
4. Test bipedal locomotion in simulation
5. Evaluate stability and gait quality

## Quiz/Questions

1. What are the main challenges in bipedal locomotion compared to wheeled robots?
2. How does balance control work in humanoid robots?
3. What makes human-robot interaction "natural"?
