## What You'll Learn

This textbook will teach you to become a Physical AI engineer capable of building intelligent robots. You'll progress from theoretical understanding to real-world applications:

- **Robot Operating System (ROS 2)**: Master the nervous system of modern robots
- **Digital Twins**: Simulate and test robots in virtual environments before deployment
- **AI Integration**: Deploy perception and navigation systems on edge computing devices
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Create robots that understand and respond to natural language commands
- **Hardware Integration**: Work with real humanoid robots and understand hardware requirements

By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to build and deploy autonomous humanoid robots capable of understanding and interacting with the physical world through natural language commands.
