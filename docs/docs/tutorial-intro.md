# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This interactive tutorial bridges digital AI (LLMs, agents) with physical bodies, teaching embodied intelligence through simulation → edge device → real humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

## About This Tutorial

This tutorial is designed for:
- Students who already know Python, basic deep learning, and AI agents
- Aspiring roboticists and AI engineers aged 18–35
- Complete beginners in robotics (never touched ROS or Gazebo before)

## Course Structure

This tutorial follows a strict 4-module, 13-week curriculum:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Weeks 3-5
2. **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Weeks 6-7
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Weeks 8-10
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Week 13

Plus additional content for:
- Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI
- Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Install and run ROS 2 Humble/Iron on Ubuntu 22.04
- Build and simulate a humanoid robot in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Write Python ROS 2 nodes that control a real or simulated robot
- Deploy perception (VSLAM) and navigation (Nav2) on a Jetson Orin
- Create a Vision-Language-Action pipeline where a robot understands voice commands
- Complete the full capstone: an autonomous simulated humanoid that navigates, recognizes objects, and manipulates them using only natural language instructions
- Choose and budget the exact hardware needed
