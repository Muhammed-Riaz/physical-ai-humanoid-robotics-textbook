# Student Gallery

This page is reserved for showcasing outstanding student projects and contributions to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. While currently empty, we envision it as a vibrant space celebrating the creativity and innovation of our learners.

## Future Submissions

In the future, students will be able to submit their capstone projects, lab implementations, or other relevant work for inclusion in this gallery. We encourage you to push the boundaries of what's possible with Physical AI and contribute to the growing community.

## Stay Tuned!
