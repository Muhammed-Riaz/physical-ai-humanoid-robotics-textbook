# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Weeks 6-7

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical robot that allows for testing and development in a simulated environment. This module covers physics simulation and environment building using Gazebo and Unity, with focus on simulating sensors and creating realistic environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Set up Gazebo simulation environment
- Create physics simulations with gravity and collisions
- Build high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulate sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs
- Understand the importance of digital twins in robotics

## Key Concepts with Analogies

- **Digital Twin**: Like a flight simulator for pilots, a digital twin allows robot developers to practice and test without risk
- **Physics Simulation**: Like a wind tunnel for aircraft, physics simulation allows testing of robot behavior in controlled conditions
- **Sensor Simulation**: Like a driving simulator that mimics real-world conditions, sensor simulation provides realistic data for robot algorithms

## Hands-on Lab: Creating a Gazebo Environment

In this lab, students will create a simulated environment for a humanoid robot with realistic physics.

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Gazebo installed
- Basic understanding of ROS 2

### Steps
1. Create a new Gazebo world
2. Add physics properties (gravity, friction)
3. Create a humanoid robot model
4. Add sensor simulation (LiDAR, camera)
5. Test the simulation with ROS 2 integration

## Quiz/Questions

1. What are the advantages of using a digital twin in robotics development?
2. How does Gazebo simulate physics differently from other simulators?
3. Why is sensor simulation important for robotics development?
