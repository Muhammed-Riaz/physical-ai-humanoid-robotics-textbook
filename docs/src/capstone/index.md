# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Overview

The capstone project is the culmination of your learning in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. You will build an autonomous simulated humanoid robot that receives voice commands, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies objects using computer vision, and manipulates them.

## Project Goal

To demonstrate an integrated understanding of ROS 2, robot simulation (Gazebo/Isaac Sim), AI perception (VSLAM), navigation (Nav2), and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines by developing a fully autonomous simulated humanoid robot.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the capstone project, you will be able to:
- Integrate ROS 2 nodes for complex robot behaviors
- Utilize simulated environments for testing and validation
- Implement VSLAM for localization and mapping
- Apply Nav2 for autonomous navigation
- Develop a Vision-Language-Action pipeline for natural language control
- Debug and troubleshoot complex robotic systems

## Project Phases

1.  **Environment Setup**: Setting up the simulated environment and humanoid robot model.
2.  **Perception Integration**: Integrating camera, LiDAR, and IMU sensors for VSLAM and object recognition.
3.  **Navigation Stack**: Implementing Nav2 for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
4.  **VLA Pipeline**: Developing the voice command interface and cognitive planning for action execution.
5.  **Autonomous Execution**: Combining all components for fully autonomous operation.

## Success Criteria

- The simulated humanoid robot successfully receives and interprets voice commands.
- It autonomously navigates to specified locations, avoiding obstacles.
- It accurately identifies and locates target objects using computer vision.
- It performs manipulation tasks (e.g., picking up a specific object) based on natural language instructions.
- The entire pipeline operates robustly in a simulated environment.

## Challenge

This project will challenge you to apply all the concepts learned throughout the textbook. Expect to encounter real-world robotics challenges, requiring problem-solving, debugging, and critical thinking.
