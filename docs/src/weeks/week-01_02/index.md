# Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview

These weeks provide the foundation for Physical AI and embodied intelligence. Students will learn about the transition from digital AI to robots that understand physical laws, explore the humanoid robotics landscape, and understand sensor systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of these weeks, students will be able to:
- Understand the foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Explain the transition from digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
- Overview the humanoid robotics landscape
- Identify and understand sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors
- Appreciate the challenges and opportunities in Physical AI

## Key Concepts with Analogies

- **Physical AI**: Like how the human brain controls the body, Physical AI connects digital intelligence with physical action
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Like how intelligence emerges from the interaction between mind and body, embodied intelligence emerges from the interaction between AI and physical systems
- **Sensor Systems**: Like human senses (sight, hearing, touch), robot sensors provide information about the environment

## Hands-on Lab: Sensor Data Exploration

In this lab, students will explore data from different robot sensors and understand their characteristics.

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of AI fundamentals

### Steps
1. Explore LIDAR data and understand point clouds
2. Examine camera data and image processing
3. Work with IMU data and understand orientation
4. Analyze force/torque sensor data
5. Combine multiple sensor inputs

## Quiz/Questions

1. What is the difference between digital AI and Physical AI?
2. Why is embodied intelligence important for humanoid robots?
3. What are the main types of sensors used in humanoid robots?
