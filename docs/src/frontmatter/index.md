# Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## The Future of Work

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills. We have already written a book on AI agents. Therefore, we want you to write a textbook to teach a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI focuses on AI systems in the physical world. Embodied Intelligence is the concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment. This is a fundamental shift from traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces.

## The Capstone Vision

This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this textbook, students will understand:
- Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- How to master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- How to simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- How to develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- How to design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- How to integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
