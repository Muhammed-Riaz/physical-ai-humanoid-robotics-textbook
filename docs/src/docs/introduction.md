# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This interactive textbook bridges digital AI (LLMs, agents) with physical bodies, teaching embodied intelligence through simulation → edge device → real humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

## Course Structure

This textbook follows a strict 4-module, 13-week curriculum:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Weeks 3-5
2. **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Weeks 6-7
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Weeks 8-10
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Week 13

Plus additional content for:
- Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI
- Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development
